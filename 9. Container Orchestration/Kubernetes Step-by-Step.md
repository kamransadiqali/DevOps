- A container is a solution that runs code (the application) in an
isolated environment.
- The container is based on a container image.
•	The application can run on any platform: cloud as well as
computer.
•	The container image is static and portable, and doesn't contain
any site-specific information.
•	While running the container, site-specific information is
dynamically added.
•	Container images are archives containing all that is needed to
run the app.
•	Linux features provide isolation through namespaces.
•	The container runs on top of a container runtime.
•	The container runtime is an abstraction layer that runs on top
of any operating system, as well as cloud.
•	The result is a container image that runs anywhere and includes
all dependencies it needs to run.
•	The container runtime turns the container image into a running
application and provides key features
•	image management
•	container execution (already in the definition)
•	accessibility
•	storage
•	security (namespaces)
•	logging and monitoring
•	The runtime runs on any platform: Linux, Windows, MacOS, as
well as cloud
