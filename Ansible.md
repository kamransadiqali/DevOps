# Installation
```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible
```
To check ansibel version:
```
ansible --version
```
# Inventory
Ansible works against multiple systems in your infrastructure at the same time. It does this by selecting portions of systems listed in Ansibleâ€™s inventory file, which defaults to being saved in the below location.
```
cat /etc/ansible/hosts
```
Add one line to our default inventory:
```
192.168.25.16 ansible_ssh_pass=password
```
Ping the localhost using Ad-Hoc Commands on Local Machine
```
ansible -m ping localhost
```

Ping this IP through Ansible using below command:
```
ansible 192.168.25.16 -m ping
```
Creating custom inventory file
- Disabling host key checking Firstly, make a change in ansible.cfg file which is located at /etc/ansible directory Uncomment the line host_key_checking = False
- Create inventory file In /etc/ansible/ directory, and create inventory.txt file, and add below details to it: vi inventory.txt
```
webserver1 ansible_host=192.168.25.16 ansible_ssh_pass=password ansible_connection=ssh ansible_port=22 ansible_user=root
dbserver1 ansible_host=192.168.25.17 ansible_ssh_pass=password ansible_connection=ssh ansible_port=22 ansible_user=root
```
To ping all the machines in inventory1.txt file, use the command below:
```
ansible all -m ping -i inventory1.txt
```
To ping all the hostnames starting with 'webserver', we can also use wild card (*) using below command:
```
ansible webserver* -m ping -i inventory2.txt
```
Organizing Servers Into Groups and Subgroups in Inventory file
```
[webservers]
webserver1
webserver2
webserver3

[dbservers]
dbserver1
dbserver2
dbserver3
```
